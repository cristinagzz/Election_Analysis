## Challenge Overview and Summary
We helped Seth to gather the information of the election results. During this project we evaluate through python using Visual Studio Code, the candidates options, how many votes they recieved per county and the winner of he elections. We extract the complete list of candidates who recieved votes as well as the total number of votes of each candidate and finally the winners of the elections based on their votes as well as the more votesper couny.

This was very useful tool to gather the necesary information in order to determine the winner as well as the total votes. This was a long and challenging activity but very useful for future projects.
