And the winner was Diana DeGette with 272,892 vote count with a 73.8% of votes.

## Challenge Overview and Summary
We helped Seth to gather the information of the election results. During this project we evaluate tue total number of votes, we extract the complete list of candidates who recieved votes as well as the total number of votes of each candidate and finally the winners of the elections based on their votes.  
This was a very long classwork as we had to retieve all the information in order to determine the winners of the election plus the total votes for each of them and finally, get to know the final winner of the elections.
